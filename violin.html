    e violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string
    instrument) in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body.
    <br />
    It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the
    family in regular use.<br />
    The violin typically has four strings, (some can have five), usually tuned
    in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, <br />
    and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also
    be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in
    specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow
    (col legno).
